# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

- I have created this study guide to use throughout my course to take notes.
- This project in itself was a learning experience requring the use and set up of sites and software such as VS code, GitHub and the use of the terminal application.
- Through setting up this webpage it has allowed me to grasp the basic and commmon functions that are constantly used when setting up a webpage, for example I now feel fairly comfortable navigating directories and branches using git commands in terminal.
